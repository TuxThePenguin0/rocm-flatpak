============

This repo is an initial cut of building the AMD ROCm stack for
Flatpak 23.08.  It currently builds OpenCL. The ROCm Runtime
Extension it builds sits on top of the Mesa in Freedesktop SDK
org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default; so you will need to use both to
get working OpenGL+OpenCL.

Building
--------

23.08 is based on BuildStream2.  

Install Buildstream2 and plugins:

1. Install BuildStream2:
```
sudo dnf install bubblewrap fuse3 git lzip patch python3 python3-pip
pip3 install buildstream buildstream-external bst-plugins-experimental buildstream-plugins dulwich
```
2. Build this repo, and export to a Flatpak repo:
```
bst build rocm-flatpak.bst
bst artifact checkout --directory ~/rocm-repo rocm-flatpak.bst
flatpak remote-add --user rocm-repo ~/rocm-repo --no-gpg-verify
flatpak install --user org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.ROCm
```

2. 1. (optional) Export the build product to a single-file bundle
```
flatpak build-bundle --runtime ~/rocm-repo rocm.flatpak org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.ROCm 23.08
```

3. Using ROCm for OpenCL:  
Currently the Freedesktop SDK doesn't know how to autoload the AMD ROCm
extension. Until it does you'll need to update the FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS
environment variable to run OpenCL apps. Example:
```
‚ùØ export FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS=ROCm:default
```

If you use systemd, you can use the following to set this permanently
into your environment:
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d
echo FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS=ROCm:default | tee ~/.config/environment.d/60-flatpak_gl_drivers.conf
```
After a logout and login, or reboot you should see FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS
set in the environment.

ClInfo:
```
‚ùØ flatpak run --device=all --command=/bin/bash --devel org.freedesktop.Platform.ClInfo
[üì¶ org.freedesktop.Platform.ClInfo ~]$ clinfo

Issues, Workarounds and Caveats
--------------------------------
1. /dev/kfd
Currently the --device=dri flag doesn't enable access to /dev/kfd, which
is required for ROCm to function. You'll need to pass --device=all to
any apps to allow ROCm to see /dev/kfd.  You can use Flatseal to add
this to apps and make it permanent.

2. Freedesktop Bug  
There is also a bug in the Freedesktop SDK provided Mesa OpenCL with
(?) some AMD cards (?) which stops ROCm OpenCL device being used even
when hard coded in the app.  This happens with e.g. the Radeon 5500M in
the MacbookPro16,4.
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/4189
In this case, you can force apps to only "see" the ROCm OpenCL
implementation by setting the following environment variable into the
app using e.g. Flatseal:

```
OCL_ICD_VENDORS=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/GL/ROCm/OpenCL/vendors
```

3. Old Cards  
Older cards (RX580, etc) will require additional variables. You can 
set these into the app with Flatseal, or add them to /etc/environment 
or similar.
